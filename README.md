# useLevenbergMarquardt
This project is a simple implement of Levenberg-Marquardt method for solving nonlinear least square problem. It is actual a kind 
of trust-region method in numerical optimization. You can read the PDF in the project for the details of the algorithm. We use the
example in chapter 6 of slambook by gaoxiang to test the algorithm. The result is as follows:<br>
